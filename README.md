# L3gion

I aim to create a basic engine with the help of TheCerno's video series as a mentor to guide me as i go. So far I've been following his steps and making changes along the way.

The L3gion engine as of now uses OpenGL with glfw and Glad as the render API, and can only draw 2D quads on the screen (batch rendering).
ImGui support.
It has profiling and Loggin build in it.
It works on a system based on layers and events.
Input has events and pulling.
